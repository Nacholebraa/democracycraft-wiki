# Client Modifications

## Introduction
While most enjoy the Vanilla Minecraft experience, some of us prefer to make some changes. Below is a guide to the resourcepacks and client-side mods that have been approved by our staff team. 
This is not an exhaustive list, rather just a list of mods that we have already approved. Mods can be used outside of this list in accordance with the client modifications rule.

## Resourcepacks
Resource packs (aka texture packs) are used to change the appearance of the game.

### Prohibited Resource Packs
- X-Ray packs (gives a player the ability to see through non-transparent blocks)
- Fullbright packs.
- Any other pack which may give a player an unfair advantage.

### Democracycarft Resource Pack
The Official DemocracyCraft Resourcepack (full texture overhaul with custom homescreen)
/getrp or /getresourcepack in-game and select it from the GUI

### Guns Resource Pack
Guns & Ammo Resourcepack (see custom textures for guns and ammo)
/getrp or /getresourcepack in-game and select it from the GUI

:::tip It never hurts to ask!
If you have a mod you are thinking of playing with but don't see it here. You can always ask a staff member for approval within a ``Support Ticket`` on discord.
